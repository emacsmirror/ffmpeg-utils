* Intro

A ffmpeg command utils wrapper for Emacs.

* Installation

* Usage

** ffmpeg cut media file clip based on region selected start and end timestamps

For example, you have text like this:

#+begin_example
00:20:13 -- 01:04:15
#+end_example

Use region to select upper start/end timestamp part, then press command =[M-x ffmpeg-cut-clip]= to
select corresponding files following interactive prompt. It will invoke command-line =ffmpeg= to cut
media file clip and save to specific output file path.

This will save manually input command every time and calculating ffmpeg timestamp length.
